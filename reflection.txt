The middleware in the application allows us to reuse the code that searches MongoDB for a listing based on it's id. This is specifically used when we are Reading Updating, and Deleting listings. Additionally by adding middleware that converts addresses, we provide an easy way of accessing the data derived from a listing's address. This is used when we both create and update a listing, and is somewhat similar to the concept of a trigger in an SQL database. The abstractions provided by middleware are useful because they mean that we have better code resuse and more modularity.
